# Home

The main page is dynamic which means that I'm only showing the widgets that are in an active state from the other rooms.

## 1. Greetings

I like to show a greeting using the [Mushroom Title](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/title.md). It kinda help formatting the page and make it look like an official device. In the subtitle of that card I'm declaring what's up for dinner tonight. You can add this code in the subtitle to do the same if you have [Mealie HACS](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie-hacs).

``Le souper de ce soir sera {{ states('sensor.mealie_todays_meal') }}.``

## 2. People

Right under I like to show who's home or away with [Mushroom Person Cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/person.md). You can achieve it with an horizontal stack and this code example

```
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:mushroom-person-card
    entity: person.REPLACEME
    layout: horizontal
    icon_type: entity-picture
  - type: custom:mushroom-person-card
    entity: person.REPLACEME
    icon_type: entity-picture
```

## 3. Dynamic Cards

A few examples would be if there's music playing, if there's laundry ongoing, etc. You can quickly set this up by copy pasting cards from your room and integrate them in a [Conditional Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/conditional/). Set the condition so that it only appears if the state is active.

Here's an example with Spotify that will only be showing when there's a song playing

```
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: media_player.spotify
    state: playing
card:
  type: media-control
  entity: media_player.spotify
  name: Spotify
  tap_action: null
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/media
```
