# ha-graphite-mobile-dashboard
Sharing my custom dashboard since my friend asked for it. Since he offered me to help with the code I thought it would make sense to host it on my Github. Might as well share it publicly so that more people can help.

The goal of this mobile dashboard is to fix 2 things that I think are missing from Home Assistant. First looking good. Second being actually practical. Home-Assistant is a very good tool but I think it's ugly and all over the place. This dashboard isn't ready all of the box. You'll still have the pleasure to setup and learn Home-Assistant to your liking. It's more like a way to organize your dashbaord to achieve a clean look while keeping it practical.

## 1. Header

On all the pages I'm using [Mushroom Chips Card](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/chips.md) for showing various information. On the homepage I like to show the outdoor temperature, alarm system and opened lights. For the rooms I'm showing the room temperature, room humidity and opened lights.

## 2. Main Page

The main page is dynamic which means that I'm only showing the widgets that are in an active state from the other rooms.

I like to show a greeting using the [Mushroom Title](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/title.md). It kinda help formatting the page and make it look like an official device. In the subtitle of that card I'm declaring what's up for dinner tonight. You can add this code in the subtitle to do the same if you have [Mealie HACS](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie-hacs).

``Le souper de ce soir sera {{ states('sensor.mealie_todays_meal') }}.``

Right under I like to show who's home or away with [Mushroom Person Cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/person.md). You can achieve it with an horizontal stack and this code example

```
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:mushroom-person-card
    entity: person.REPLACEME
    layout: horizontal
    icon_type: entity-picture
  - type: custom:mushroom-person-card
    entity: person.REPLACEME
    icon_type: entity-picture
```

## 2.1 Dynamic Cards

A few examples would be if there's music playing, if there's laundry ongoing, etc. You can quickly set this up by copy pasting cards from your room and integrate them in a [Conditional Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/conditional/). Set the condition so that it only appears if the state is active.

Here's an example with Spotify that will only be showing when there's a song playing

```
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: media_player.spotify
    state: playing
card:
  type: media-control
  entity: media_player.spotify
  name: Spotify
  tap_action: null
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/media
```

## 3. Rooms

Here I'm using [UI-Lovelace-Minimalist room cards](https://ui-lovelace-minimalist.github.io/UI/usage/cards/card_room/) but without UI-Lovelace-Minimalist which I find it to be too much overhead and I like to keep my install as minimal as possible. I'm using an [Horizontal Stack Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/horizontal-stack/) in order to show 2 room card per row which I found to be the best for a mobile dashboard. Those room cards are the only way to navigate the rooms in the dashboard which leave the dashboard menu to be used for other stuff. The room card will display:

- Room name and icon
- Up to 4 customizable icons (ex. climate, lights, appliance)
- Room temperature and humidity
- Customizable color

I like to use the first icon for the climate control and the second icon for lights control. Basically those icons are a shortcut to avoid navigating in the room and control that room faster. I reserve the third and fourth icons in case that a room has an appliance I'd like to quickly access. Examples would be media center in living room, oven in kitchen, laundry appliances in bathroom, etc.

### 3.1 Add the card-room template

In order to be able to use the room cards in your dashboard you'll have to edit your dashboard in the Raw Configuration Editor. Copy the code from [room-card.yaml](https://github.com/gravelfreeman/ha-mobile-dashboard/blob/main/rooms.yaml
) into your dashboard raw yaml configuration file.

You must paste it before the data of your configuration file. It should be before your first page and exactly before:

`title: YOUR_TITLE`

### 3.2 Add a custom card-room in your dashboard

The way it work is that you creating a custom template card for 2 rooms that'll be diplayed horizontally. Add as many as you want and they'll nicely work together. Here's an example for 2 rooms.

```
type: vertical-stack
title: Pi√®ces
cards:
  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - type: custom:button-card
        template:
          - card_room
          - purple_no_state # THIS VALUE CHANGE THE COLOR OF YOUR CARD
