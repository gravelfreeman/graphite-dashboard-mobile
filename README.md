# graphite-dashboard-mobile
Sharing my custom dashboard since my friend asked for it. Since he offered me to help with the code I thought it would make sense to host it on my Github. Might as well share it publicly so that more people can help.

The goal of this mobile dashboard is to fix 2 things that I think are missing from Home Assistant. First looking good. Second being actually practical. Home-Assistant is a very good tool but I think it's ugly and all over the place. This dashboard isn't ready all of the box. You'll still have the pleasure to setup and learn Home-Assistant to your liking. It's more like a way to organize your dashbaord to achieve a clean look while keeping it practical.
