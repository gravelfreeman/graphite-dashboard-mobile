# Media

I'll be honest this section is pretty much broken and I hadn't much time to make it work. My media center is an Apple TV and right now I'm stuck in getting pyATV to open Spotify playlist links from a Home-Assitant button to the Apple TV. This could replace spotify-card which can't start a playlist on your device in a single click. For example in my case I need a button in order to turn on the amp on the right input, open the television, open the Apple TV and then send the playlist command.

I opened [this issue](https://github.com/postlund/pyatv/issues/2311) on pyATV, please raise your voice if you want me to build a button template to automate starting playlists on an Apple TV!
